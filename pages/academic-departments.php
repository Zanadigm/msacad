                    <hr />
                    <p>The English department aims to achieve a balance between equipping pupils with practical skills, and giving students enthusiasm for language and literature that will provide lifelong pleasure. English teaching at all levels takes into account the international nature of the school and aims to satisfy the needs of individual pupils.</p><a href="#" id="mfano1-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('mfano1');return false;"><button>More about English </button></a>

                            <p>In the first years, Kindergarten to Year 3, English is taught by class teachers, with the aim of providing communicative competence in listening and speaking, accurate writing of small units of language, and knowledge of the elements of grammar and punctuation. The enjoyment of reading is also encouraged.</p>
                            <p>English is taught as a specialist subject from Year 4 onwards. A reading text for each term, forms the basis for developing skills in both language and literature. The texts are supplemented by shorter works, short stories, poetry, and plays. Students undertake a variety of tasks which practise skills required for the IGCSE level examination. Computer based skills are also encouraged through the use of the Internet and word processing.</p>
                            <p>In Year 10 and Year 11 English Language and English Literature are taken separately, with Literature an option. The Language course is based on the objectives of the IGCSE level papers: accurate and discerning reading; controlled writing in a variety of modes; writing to suit a variety of forms, audiences and purposes. Overall the development of language skills is the central objective. English Literature is also an IGCSE course and comprises close study and critical analysis of poetry, prose, and drama. Development of analytical skills, essay writing and awareness of social-historical contexts form the basis of this study.</P>
                            <p>At 'A' level, English Literature is offered as a modular course in which two modules may be completed in the first year and two in the second. The work comprises close study of texts, with analysis and commentary using techniques of literary criticism, and also detailed critical study of extracts from a variety of forms of prose and poetry. Normally eight texts are studied from a range of periods and national and cultural origins. Wide reading outside the texts is required, and students are encouraged to attend live drama performances, watch films of plays, and immerse themselves in a literary milieu. Extensive analytical writing is required, an interpretation of a range of texts, and an understanding how historical -cultural contexts shape literature . 'A' level English Literature can lead to further study and courses in: literature, law, journalism, media studies, and publishing.</p><a href="#" id="mfano1-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('mfano1');return false;">Close it</a>

                    <hr />
                    <p> French is taught to all pupils up to Year 11. In the Preparatory School, pupils start French in Year 1 where the emphasis is on conversation. The children learn how to introduce themselves and give each other personal information. In Year 4 and 5 basic grammar is introduced and pupils start acquiring vocabulary. A balance is kept between speaking, listening and writing, with one lesson per week devoted to conversation. Poems, songs and games are used to reinforce the language and make learning fun.</p><a href="#" id="mfano2-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('mfano2');return false;"><button>More about French </button></a>

                            <p>In the Senior School, pupils have four French lessons per week and now the emphasis changes as the key to success in examination lies in a secure knowledge of grammar. In Years 7, 8 and 9 pupils are given a good working knowledge of basic sentence structures and the main grammatical features of the language. Conversation plays a vital part in language learning as students have to prepare for I.G.C.S.E exams in Year 11. They are required to write formal and informal letters and read newspaper articles and signs used in everyday life in France.</p>
                            <p>With the I.G.C.S.E we hope to make the learning of the language more practical and this will enable the students to cope in any situation. In the 6th Form, French can be studied at 'A' level. During the two year course, students are introduced to a wide range of language skills as the final examination consists of six modules. French can also be studied at 'AS' level. </p><a href="#" id="mfano2-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('mfano2');return false;">Close it</a>

                    <hr />
                    <p>Mathematics is a compulsory subject for all pupils up to 'O' Level. We follow the University of London's Mathematics syllabus B, which brings together the 'modern' and 'traditional' approaches to 'O' Level mathematics. The emphasis of the syllabus is more on understanding and application of concepts, rather than on mechanical solutions of problems.</p><a href="#" id="mfano3-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('mfano3');return false;"><button>More about Mathematics </button></a>

                            <p>We also offer Additional Mathematics for pupils in Year 10 whose competence may have developed early. This course assumes knowledge of the topics contained in the syllabus for the ordinary Mathematics 'O' Level and extends the content of the course.</p>
                            <p>At 'A' Level the school offers Pure Mathematics which includes Algebra, Vectors, Calculus, Trigonometry, Complex Numbers, Functions, Approximation and Differential Equations. Other modules may be possible, depending on the size of the 'A' Level class. The course is intended for both the Mathematics specialist and those who need it for courses in Engineering or Technology, and it may be studied in combination with any other subjects. Success in the subject requires both ability and motivation and we recommend that students should have gained grade A or B in their 'O' Level and at least grade C in Additional Mathematics, if taken. The course is modular and all pupils are required to sit for 'A/S' level Mathematics in Year 12 and then proceed with the remaining modules in Year 13.</p><a href="#" id="mfano3-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('mfano3');return false;">Close it</a>

                            <p>Pupils in Years 5 and 6 investigate the physical geography of Kenya, develop their map skills and develop their ability to recognise patterns by studying agricultural patterns, the weather and patterns of land use in a settlement.</p>
                            <p>In Year 7 pupils study a broad variety of topics designed to give a solid foundation upon which to base further studies towards G.C.E 'O' level Geography. They study physical processes that change the environment like weathering, erosion and deposition. They also study Human activities such as farming and industries and their impact on the environment.</p>
                            <p>In Year 8 pupils study Human, Physical and |Environmental topics. They include weather and climate, ecosystems, soil erosion, global warming, volcanoes and earthquakes, and human geography of Kenya. They also do map reading skills.</p>
                            <p>In Year 9 the subject is still compulsory for all pupils, who begin to follow the G.C.E 'O' level course, and in Year 10 it may be chosen as an option to be continued to examination level. All topics are taught in strict conformity with the University of London G.C.E syllabus. In Year 9 pupils focus on Global Economic Activities and Environmental Issues. In Years 10 and 11, the core of Physical Geography, namely Geomorphology and Climatology is developed, and at the same time the practical aspects of Cartography and Fieldwork are encouraged. The Human aspects of Geography are also covered in these years, Development Issues and Population stressing the contrasts between developed and developing countries by focusing on a broad range of case studies.</p>
                            <p>Geography is also offered as an 'A' level subject, covering a broad range of modules. The syllabus enables students to acquire: an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the nature and functioning of selected physical and human environments at a range of scales; an understanding of the inter-relationships and interactions between and within the physical and human environments; a range of practical skills to support and enhance their geographical knowledge and understanding.</p><a href="#" id="mfano4-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('mfano4');return false;">Close it</a>

                    <hr />
                    <p>Music is included in the weekly timetable from Kindergarten through to Year 8. The department aims to promote enjoyment, awareness and understanding of a wide range of music, both 'classical' and 'popular', from around the world, as well as to develop each child's own musical skills and confidence. Singing and practical music-making form a large part of the curriculum.</p><a href="#" id="mfano10-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('mfano10');return false;"><button>More on Music</button></a>

                    <h3>Physical Education</h3>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Physical Education is an important and busy part of the pupils' lives. Curriculum time is split into three sections: Swimming, Games and Physical Education and all children gain access to a wide and varied programme of activities during the course of each academic year.</p><a href="#" id="mfano11-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('mfano11');return false;"><button>More on Physical Education</button></a>
                    <div id="mfano11" class="moredisplay">
                        <div class="dropdownpanel">
                            <p>Specialist Physical Education starts when the children are 5 years old (Year 1) and continues until they finish their schooling, at either 16 or 18 years of age. The philosophy of the department's approach is one of mixed ability teaching so that all pupils, regardless of their differing strengths and abilities, will gain experience in as wide a range of sports as possible. They are also encouraged to believe in the benefits of physical activity of all kinds, so that they can pursue an active lifestyle when they leave school.</p>
                            <p>The organisation of the curriculum is based broadly on the English school system. In swimming, pupils remain with their class until Year 8. Thereafter, they are split according to gender to pursue more specialised swimming activities. Their Games lessons are split by gender to follow appropriate sporting specialism, and their Physical Education lessons are all mixed to allow for further group interaction. From Year 1 to 2 the emphasis is on the child's cognitive development, both in and out of water. From a broad range of activities designed to improve co-ordination in Motor skills, we hope to provide the children with the necessary skill base to then move on to more specific sporting activities.</p>
                            <p>In Year 3 those specialization begins. In swimming, pupils will experience activities including stroke improvement, personal survival, life-saving, water polo, synchronised swimming and diving. In Physical Education and Games, the pupils will have access to gymnastics, volleyball, health related fitness, tennis, athletics, cricket, rounders, soccer, rugby, basketball, hockey, netball, squash, badminton, dance, and outdoor education.</p>
                            <p>Pupils also have the opportunity to compete in a lively House System over a wide range of sporting activities and may then go on to represent the school in fixtures against other schools. Traditionally, the school has always had a very good swimming team and is generally regarded as one of the strongest teams in Kenya. The school also competes in rugby, soccer, basketball, volleyball, netball, squash, hockey, rounders and badminton. These fixtures often require trips to Nairobi to compete with schools there.</p><a href="#" id="mfano11-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('mfano11');return false;">Close it</a>
