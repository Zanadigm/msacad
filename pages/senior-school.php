                        <h2>Senior School</h2>
                        <p>This Department encompasses 7 years of study, from Year 7 to Year 13. Teaching is organised departmentally so that pupils move to subject rooms for their lessons. All teaching staff are well-qualified graduates.</p>
                        <p>Pupils in Years 7, 8 and 9 study a full range of subjects, including Art, Language and Music but make their subject choices for IGCSE in the third term of Year 9.</p>
                        <p>At the end of Year 11, they are expected to sit 8 or 9 external examinations which should include English, Mathematics, Science, Language and a Humanities subject. Subjects offered are: Art, Biology, Chemistry, Economics, English Language, English Literature, French, Geography, History, ICT, Mathematics, Pure Mathematics and Physics.</p>
                        <p>Year 12 pupils are expected to take three ‘AS’ subjects with the aim of continuing them into Year 13 for a full ‘A’ Level. Subjects available are: Art, Biology, Business Studies, Chemistry, Economics, English Literature, French, Geography, ICT, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics. Representatives from various Universities visit throughout the year to help the pupils in Years 12 and 13 make Higher Education study choices. The majority of our ‘A’ level students go on to universities in the UK.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the Senior School, all pupils participate in Physical Education and swimming lessons as well as the wide range of extra-curricular activities that are available.</p>
                        <p>In the Secondary School, pupils study with increasing specialisation and good, independent study skills. These skills gained throughout their years at Mombasa Academy will make a significant difference to their levels of achievement. Taking pride in work of the highest quality, a positive attitude, along with determination to work hard, will equip pupils for entry into Higher Education and a successful and rewarding career.</p>
                        <p>We encourage our pupils to be successful and to reach their full potential. Our policy is confirmed by the high pass rate in public examinations every year. Our pupils go on to excel in future life as well-adjusted adults having had a broad and balanced education.</p>
