                <p>The school was established in 1978 by Mr. F.J Bentley who was a pioneer of private education in Kenya. Its situation is Nyali, a prime residential area, ensured that its population was drawn from the large number of expatriate families residing nearby. </p>
                <p> The school buildings consisted of the ground floor of the Headmaster's residence, seven classrooms and one laboratory. In 1980 the school's half-olympic size swimming pool was completed, followed by the Music and Mathematics rooms in 1981. The school's multi-purpose Assembly Hall was built in 1982 and a further 2.5 acre plot across the road was acquired in 1984 for playing fields.</p>
                <p>In 1986, the school changed hands following the sudden illness of its founder. The new owner, Mr. Prem Prinja, injected a substantial amount of capital into its infrastructure, equipment and landscaping. Sea View Road was tarmaced. A new Secondary block comprising six classrooms, an audio-visual room, a Biology Laboratory and an ablution block was built in 1987. </p>
                <p>After completion of eight classrooms in 1989, the Junior school comprising the Lower Kindergarten to Year 2 was moved from the main campus to the adjacent plot. On this same site six studio flats for teaching staff were erected. Since then a further fourteen flats have been added. </p>
