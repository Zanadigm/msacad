                        <h2>Junior School</h2>
                        <p>Situated in its own grounds with playing facilities, this department accepts children from three years of age in Kindergarten up to eight years of age in Class 3. The classes in each year group are of mixed ability.</p>
                        <p>In Kindergarten and Transition, children learn to socialise and interact with a group, to recognise and write letters and numbers, and begin to read and write and cope with basic mathematical concepts. Our aim is to make learning enjoyable and arouse the children's natural curiosity about life and the environment. Plenty of play, singing, stories, outdoor and indoor games, art and craft are included in the curriculum.</p>
                        <p>From Transition children proceed to classes 1, 2 and 3 where they work a little more formally, but we hope with equal enthusiasm and enjoyment. They are now able to study topics in more depth, and as well as their more structured lessons, Physical Education specialists teach basic ball skills, minor games and gymnastics. In this age of technology it is important that every child should be computer literate and all children, from Kindergarten to Class 3, have access to computers. They learn computer skills through educational games and play. These lessons also reinforce their literacy and numeracy skills. </p>
                        <p>French is introduced in Class 1 and is taught in a fun, informal way by a French speaking teacher. They do not read or write in French until Class 4. In Class 3, Science is also introduced as a separate subject and is taught by a specialised teacher. From Class 1 children are placed in one of the three school Houses and attend meetings once a week and learn to support their Houses in both work and sports activities.</p>
                        <p>All classes in this department make regular use of the school pool, the main hall and audio visual facilities. They also have their own Sports Day, Swimming Gala and Concert.</P>
