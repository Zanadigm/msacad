                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <h3>Our Objective</h3>
                <p>An effective school emphasizes an atmosphere of educational excellence. Students are encouraged to be successful, to reach their potential and to exhibit responsibility for their own academic and social behaviour </p>
                <h3>Aims </h3>
                <p> The education provided by the school aims to develop the individual talents of each pupil to the full. To this end, the school encourages its pupils to strive for excellence in all endeavours, be they academic or non-academic and to appreciate the value of self-discipline. The school's relatively small size and its friendly and caring environment ensure that each pupil can be individually known by most members of staff. Its wide- ranging sporting, social and cultural activities help pupils to develop their individual talents and abilities.</p>
                <p>Above all, growing up in a multi-cultural environment helps our pupils to overcome prejudices and to develop consideration and tolerance for the views of others, while developing their own individuality and self-reliance. </p>
